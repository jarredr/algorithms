# Algorithms

This project is an exploration and implementation of common algorithms and data structures in TypeScript.

My implementations will aim to be performant, but since this is a learning exercise, readability is favoured.

I plan to cover:

- Searching
- Sorting
- Queues
- Stacks
- Trees
- Graphs

## Running the project

1. Install Deno 2.x
2. Run `deno test` to run the tests
