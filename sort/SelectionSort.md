# Selection Sort

Selection sort is a very straight-forward but inefficient sorting algorithm.

The algorithm takes an array that you wish to sort and a comparator function which determines the ordering of the final elements. The comparator function is applied on each element of the array to find the first item of the sorted array. For example, if sorting an array of numbers in ascending order, it will find the smallest element. The process is then repeated for each item in the array. The final result will be a sorted array.

## Time complexity

- Typical: O(n^2)
- Best case: O(n^2)
- Worst case: O(n^2)
