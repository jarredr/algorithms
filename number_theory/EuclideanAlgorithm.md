# Euclidean Algorithm

The Euclidean algorithm is one of the oldest algorithms still in use. It was recorded by the Greek mathemetician Euclid in 300BC. It solves the greatest common divisor problem (GCD), which is also known as the greatest common factor (GCF).

It has a time complexity of O(log min(a, b))
