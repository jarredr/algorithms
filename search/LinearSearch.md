# Linear Search

Linear search is the most basic searching alogrithm. It scales linearly, which is worse performance than other searching algorithms, but it works on any data.

## Time complexity

- Typical: O(n)
- Best case: O(1)
- Worst case: O(n)

## Algorithm

1. Iterate through the list or array sequentially and compare each item with what you're searching for
